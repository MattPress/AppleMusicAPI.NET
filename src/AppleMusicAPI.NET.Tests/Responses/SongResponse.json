Songs are filled with dead-end factories, dark bars, and lost horizons—lyrical devices that reinforce Springsteen’s idea that salvation is found only through love. Surging opener “Badlands” and the dramatic “The Promised Land” offer hope as a vaccination against sadness and struggles, while the percolating title track—and poignant ballads “Racing in the Street” and “Factory”—subtly remind us that we were all just born to run.",

The characters are people on society’s margins, working in the shadows and struggling to get by. The title track is a masterstroke, a touching portrait of a modern-day John Steinbeck character; one can hear Bruce reach back to Woody Guthrie. For “Straight Time,” an ex-con with a new wife and kids ponders the pull of his previous life. “Youngstown” speaks from the soul of a despairing coal miner in the Ohio city. Two Mexican brothers in “Sinaloa Cowboys” end up cooking methamphetamine when fieldwork doesn’t pay the bills. Several songs here were inspired by newspaper stories, while others came from what Springsteen has witnessed around the country over the years. It’s a dark album. “My Best Was Never Good Enough” spits forth with a bitterness uncommon to Springsteen’s hopeful works. It’s a harrowing ride, but well worth taking."

This is where Springsteen becomes an electric performer, with songs that invent new structures and court deep narratives. “The E Street Shuffle” and “Kitty’s Back” are among the funkiest songs he’s recorded, while “4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)” and “Wild Billy’s Circus Story” are the warmest and most heartbreaking on the album. “Incident on 57th Street” is pure cinemascope, an elaborate tale that sweats like a classic early-‘70s film. “Rosalita (Come out Tonight)” is archetypal Springsteen, complete with Clarence Clemons chasing the Boss with his ebullient sax while the lyrics tell of Bruce’s dreams of rock stardom. “New York City Serenade” is a beast, starting with David Sancious’ elegant piano intro and working its way to a dramatic conclusion. Essential."

Often overlooked, <i>Devils &amp; Dust</i> is one of Bruce’s finest albums."

So after a quick run-through of the previously unreleased track “Red Headed Woman,” Bruce plugged in and ran through a set heavy on his then-current albums, <i>Human Touch</i> and <i>Lucky Town</i>. “Better Days” and “Lucky Town” catch fire. “I Wish I Were Blind” is riveting. “If I Should Fall Behind” and “My Beautiful Reward” are touching without lapsing into sentimentality. A scorching version of “Light of Day,” which Springsteen wrote for the movie of the same name, highlights the set. Classics such as “Darkness on the Edge of Town,” “Thunder Road,” and “Atlantic City” could use the boost of The E Street Band (only keyboardist Roy Bittan and wife Patti Scialfa kept their jobs), but it’s interesting to hear the songs in what can be considered alternate arrangements."

                          "standard": "Bruce Springsteen has been chasing his American Dream since his earliest days. From the Dylanesque colloquialisms of his first albums to the West Side Story drama that informed 1975’s <i>Born to Run</i> through the working class fever that climaxed with the acoustic home demos of 1982’s <i>Nebraska</i> to 1984’s all-out stadium tour assault with <i>Born in the U.S.A.</i>, the tugs at Woody Guthrie with 1994’s <i>The Ghost of Tom Joad</i> and finally the down-home hoe-downs of the Pete Seeger-inspired <i>We Shall Overcome</i> from 2006, Bruce Springsteen is the most unabashed American performer in modern times. <i>Live in Dublin</i> was recorded at the Point, Dublin, Ireland on November 17,18 and 19, 2006 with the touring group that first took shape in his living room. Springsteen invigorates these classic forms of American music — Dixieland, folk, blues, country, gospel and rock — with his boundless energy, injecting a preacher’s fire and brimstone to everything he sings. Most interesting, he reinvents his own catalog, as “Atlantic City,”  “If I Should Fall Behind,” “Growin’ Up” and “Blinded by the Light” among others are radically overhauled, with the countrified “Highway Patrolmen” being the immediate standout."

                          "standard": "Bruce Springsteen has it both ways here. He manages to speak for the tenor of the nation with the album's title track and attempts a western epic with the eight-minute \"Outlaw Pete,\" but elsewhere dials down the drama with short, compact pop songs that enjoy their modest surroundings. Producer Brendan O'Brien keeps the band on a tight leash, marshaling a wall of sound that's dense with ringing guitars and stealth keyboards. Springsteen yearns for his younger days with the pangs of simple infatuation on \"Queen Of the Supermarket\" and offers basic platitudes for \"What Love Can Do.\" In his desire to turn an album around quicker than he has in some time, he's left his lyrics a bit ragged, but makes up for it with an immediacy of tone. His confident vocals identify every track from the jaunty roadhouse jam of \"Good Eye\" to the somber crawl of \"The Wrestler,\" featured in the Mickey Rourke film of the same name. \"My Lucky Day,\" \"Kingdom Of Days\" and \"Surprise, Surprise\" sing out with a sincerity that recalls the AM guitar pop of the mid-'60s with Bruce looking back and figuring that some old- fashioned musical values might vault him ahead into the future."

Dylan’s songwriting talents came fast and furious. These earliest compositions include the landmark civil rights anthem “Blowin’ in the Wind”; the anti-war screeds “Masters of War”, “Talkin’ World War III Blues” and “A Hard Rain’s a-Gonna Fall”; and the romantic turns of “Girl from the North Country” and “Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right.” Modern singer-songwriting starts here.",

Also included are a handful of his greatest moments that aren’t usually recognised, like the optimistically melancholic “Not Dark Yet”, the refined and airy “Jokerman” and the gently rolling lament “Mississippi”.

Many highlights include a melancholic overhaul (featuring Johnny Cash) of Dylan’s 1963 weeper “Girl From the North Country”, and the swooning “I Threw It All Away”, which, with its spare organ and acoustic guitar, stuns as an epistle to regret. And Dylan proved that he could sing in a warm, liquid croon on the lovely, hushed “Lay Lady Lay”. This often twangy affair ranks as one of Dylan’s greatest.",

Patched together from several recording sessions, the album’s a testament to Dylan’s artistry that even with no consistent producer or backing band he can weave a coherent, touching vision. The songs range from the sweet, ramshackle pop of “If Not for You” to the rambling piano and organ of the scathing “Day of the Locusts” to the mounting title track, a salute to love and redemption.",

The album is packed with spirited, well-executed covers of old blues and folk tunes—including many eyebrow-raisers such as Bukka White’s “Fixin’ to Die”—which proved Dylan’s immense talent for song interpretation. The two originals here signalled an emerging, Woody Guthrie-inspired genius: “Song to Woody” beautifully blends poignancy and innocence while “Talkin’ New York” is rich with wit and insight, and both are uncanny accomplishments considering Dylan was only 20 years old.",

From the stuttering opening chords of “Political World” to the noirish slow-burn “Man in the Long Black Coat”, it’s also obvious that Bob Dylan’s updated sound dovetailed with fresh songwriting inspiration. Some of it has an alluringly eerie edge too, like the literate, piano-led “Ring Them Bells” and sullen heartbreaker “Most of the Time”. The album stays in your head long after the harmonica-stoked last chords of the melancholic-yet-hopeful closer, “Shooting Star”.",

For the past decade, Dylan has sounded remarkably comfortable in the recording studio, releasing a string of albums that capture vintage blues, R&amp;B and country string band music to complement his road-worn voice. \"I ain't dead yet, my bell still rings,\" he sings on the \"Mannish Boy\"-influenced \"Early Roman Kings\" and it sounds like a reassurance. Dylan susses meaning from phrases others throw away. This is dark, dusty music with secrets tucked inside its riddles. \"Duquesne Whistle,\" a collaboration with Robert Hunter, shuffles down the line. A hypnotizing riff works over \"Narrow Way\" for seven-plus minutes as Dylan quotes the Mississippi Sheiks. On \"Pay In Blood,\" Dylan sounds like a man settling a score. \"Scarlet Town\" and \"Tin Angel\" extend the narratives, but it's the title track that squeezes 45 verses into 14 minutes for an epic that wanders from shipwreck to Leonardo DiCaprio without losing the thread."
