              "standard": "James Brown never enjoyed a number one pop hit in <i>Billboard</i>, though seventeen R&amp;B chart-toppers bore his name. One that hit eighteen, \u201cDoing It to Death,\u201d was credited to Fred Wesley and the J.B.\u2019s, while \u201cGet Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine\u201d peaked at number two in <i>Billboard</i>, and at number one in the rival <i>Cashbox</i>. Brown\u2019s entry in the <i>Number 1's</i> series pays tribute to all these happy occasions by collecting the radio-friendly short versions of discs spanning 1958 (the heavenly vocal-group ballad \u201cTry Me\u201d) to 1974 (variations on the funk \u201cMy Thang,\u201d \u201cThe Payback\u201d and \u201cPapa Don\u2019t Take No Mess\u201d). All these, of course, have much to show anyone wants to understand James Brown, his music and how it sounded on the airwaves of its time. Though no longer with us, he\u2019s not about to stop teaching us now."

Mountain-of-a-man nicknames, no doubt, but not one of them ever did James Brown the justice he deserved. JB\u2019s influence is so large it\u2019s plain impossible to imagine what music today would sound like without him. James didn\u2019t just master soul and funk; he invented them. From the on-bended-knee plea called \u201cTry Me\u201d straight to ground zero of the hip-hop revolution, where his screams, grunts, and funky drummer backboned every cut worth mentioning, Brown was soul power itself, an inspiration to an entire nation. Now that Mr. Dynamite has taken his last sweat-drenched shuffle offstage, we\u2019re all left like an awe-struck Apollo audience \u2014 still screaming for just one more encore while trying to take in the force of nature we were blessed to witness. James Brown\u2019s face should be on money. His likeness carved on a mountain. And, most importantly, his music played forever."
